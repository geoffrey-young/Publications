# The Publications of Geoffrey Young

Back in the early days of dot-com, when the P in LAMP was Perl, I spent a lot of time in the Open Source arena, created some of the software that made many 
of those dot-com companies tick, and educated others on how to get the most from it.  This repository holds my published writing from that time. 

Enjoy!

## [mod_perl Developer's Cookbook](cookbook/)

I was lead author on an authortitative and well received work on [mod_perl](http://perl.apache.org/), the software that embeds the [Perl](https://www.perl.org) interpreter inside the [Apache httpd webserver](http://httpd.apache.org).  mod_perl happens to be the software that powers [Ticketmaster](http://www.ticketmaster.com), which is how I ended up working there from 2002 to 2010.

[mod_perl Developer's Cookbook](http://modperlcookbook.org/) was published by [Sams Publishing](http://www.informit.com/sams) in early 2002.

## [Articles Written for perl.com](perl.com/)

In 2003, I wrote a series of articles on mod_perl 2.0 for [perl.com](http://www.perl.com).

 * [Filters in Apache 2.0](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/04/17/filters.html) begins the series with an introduction to Apache 2.0's new output filter mechanism.
 * [Testing mod_perl 2.0](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/05/22/testing.html) discusses how to use the powerful [Apache-Test](http://httpd.apache.org/test) framework to test your mod_perl applications.
 * [Integrating mod_perl with Apache 2.1 Authentication](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/07/08/mod_perl.html) shows how to leverage the new Apache 2.1 authentication provider mechanism and write Digest providers in Perl. It's very cool stuff.
