INSTALLATION:

this module follows the standard 

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install

routine.

if you want to run the tests, you'll need to do
something similar to the following

  $ export APACHE=/usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
  $ make test

whether you choose to specify httpd or apxs depends on
whether or not your installation is has mod_so, so you may need
one or the other or both.

you can also configure the test suite when building the Makefile

  $ perl Makefile.PL -httpd /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd

run 

  $ t/TEST -help 

or see the README in the Apache::Test distribtion for more options

have fun.
